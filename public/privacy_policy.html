      <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="mb-4">
        LeSixDegrees does not collect, store, or share any personal information
        from users.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What We Store</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        We store your game progress (selected players and performance) locally
        in your browser using <code>localStorage</code>. This data never leaves
        your device and is not accessible by the website owner.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Analytics</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        We use Google Analytics to understand how users interact with the site.
        All data is anonymized and no personally identifiable information is
        collected. Analytics will only be enabled if the user consents to
        cookies. If cookies are declined, no analytics data is collected or
        transmitted.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">IP Addresses</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Google Analytics may collect users' IP addresses by default as part of
        traffic analysis. However, IP anonymization is explicitly enabled in our
        configuration to ensure that full IP addresses are never stored or
        processed. This is done to comply with privacy regulations like GDPR and
        CCPA.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Cookies</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        This site uses cookies only for analytics purposes. A cookie consent
        banner is displayed on first visit, and analytics cookies are only set
        if the user accepts. Refusing cookies disables all analytics tracking.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Your Rights</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        You have the right to request deletion of your analytics data and opt
        out of tracking. Contact us at [your@email.com] for any requests.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        We use Google Analytics to collect information about how visitors use
        this Website. This includes details such as your IP address, which is
        anonymized before being stored on Google's servers in the United States.
        IP anonymization means that a portion of your IP address is masked,
        preventing it from being used to precisely identify your location or
        device. Google uses this anonymized data to evaluate website traffic,
        generate reports for us, and provide other related services. In some
        cases, Google may transfer this information to third parties if legally
        required or if those parties process the data on Google’s behalf. You
        can disable cookies by adjusting your browser settings. By continuing to
        use this Website and accepting cookies, you agree to the collection and
        processing of your data by Google as described. For more control, you
        can opt out using the tools provided at
