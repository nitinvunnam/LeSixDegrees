      <p class="mb-4">
        LeSixDegrees does not collect, store, or share any personal information
        from users.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What We Store</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        We store your game progress (selected players and performance) locally
        in your browser using <code>localStorage</code>. This data never leaves
        your device and is not accessible by the website owner.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Analytics</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        We use Google Analytics to understand how users interact with the site.
        All data is anonymized and no personally identifiable information is
        collected. Analytics will only be enabled if the user consents to
        cookies. If cookies are declined, no analytics data is collected or
        transmitted.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">IP Addresses</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Google Analytics may collect users' IP addresses by default as part of
        traffic analysis. However, IP anonymization is explicitly enabled in our
        configuration to ensure that full IP addresses are never stored or
        processed. This is done to comply with privacy regulations like GDPR and
        CCPA.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Cookies</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        This site uses cookies only for analytics purposes. A cookie consent
        banner is displayed on first visit, and analytics cookies are only set
        if the user accepts. Refusing cookies disables all analytics tracking.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Your Rights</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        You have the right to request deletion of your analytics data and opt
        out of tracking. Contact us at [your@email.com] for any requests.
      </p>
